SC Test Schedcule

Notation:
Standard electronics notation is use
Where, R=ohms, k=kilo, etc, and can be used at the decimal point.  E.g. 0R5=0.5 Ohms, 1k4=1.4 kOhms

Setup:
3x SC in series modelled as the Pascal 5 distribution
Series resistors in Pascal model=1*550, 4*625, 6*700, 4*1k4, 1*4k
All capacitors 1F unless specified
Infinite parallel resistance, i.e. no self discharge (leakage)
Power supply is ideal except for a 1mR shunt resistor

Naming:
Datafilenames should state the following:
State of charge at start of test
Balanced or not
List of currents delivered and duration (where 'm' designated minus, i.e. discharge)
At all other time it is assumed the whole model is open circuit
